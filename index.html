    <h1>The Learn Enough Story</h1>
    <p>
        Learn Enough to Be Dangerous is a leader in the movement to teach
        technical sophistication, the seemingly magical ability to take
        command of your computer and get it to do your bidding. This includes
        everything from command lines and coding to guessing keyboard shortcuts,
   
        Googling error messages, and knowing when to just reboot the darn thing.
        We believe there are at least a billion people who can benefit from
        learning technical sophistication, probably more. To join our
        movement, sign up for our official email list now.
